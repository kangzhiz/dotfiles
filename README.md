# dotfiles

Just my dotfiles and some miscellaneous Python scripts.

Currently using macOS Monterey.

## Setting up SSH key

See instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

## Installing dotfiles

1. Clone repository into `~/Documents/dotfiles`.
2. Navigate to `~/Documents/dotfiles`.
3. Run `install.sh`.

## TODO

1. Separate install script for python packages and scripts?
